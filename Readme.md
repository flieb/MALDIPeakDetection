# MALDI Peak Detection Algorithm

This repository contains MATLAB code for the peak detection algorithm. 

Original data sets are not included. However, the simulated data set (Coombes et al., 2005) is available for download at http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Supplements/Datasets/Simulations/index.html

The file 'Results_Simulated_Data.m' is the script used to create Table 1 in the Paper. 
The file 'Results_RealData.m' shows how to utilize the spatially-aware approach.
